sake is a rapid-deployment environment suited for the separation of templating and business logic in php applications. The framework provides appropriate separation between these two application layers while emphasizing php's role as a native template language. sake is the VC of MVC frameworks, completely agnostic to the data model implemented for the job. there are sake applications using PHPActiveRecord, PHPBean, and straight MySQL-in-controller implementations.

sake tries to leave php to what it's good at while allowing developers the flexibility they need to rapidly prototype and deploy rich web applications.
