sake is a rapid-deployment environment suited for the separation of templating and business logic in php applications. The framework provides appropriate separation between these two application layers while emphasizing native php's role as a template language. sake is the VC portion of the MVC ideal. it is completely agnostic to the data model implemented for the job. there are sake applications using PHPActiveRecord, RedBeanPHP, and straight prepared MySQL-in-controller implementations.

sake tries to leave to php what it's good at while allowing developers the flexibility they need to rapidly prototype and deploy rich web applications.
